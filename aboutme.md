I’m an Engineer and Data Analytics professional currently working at Freeport McMoRan, where I develop descriptive analysis, design ETL workflows, and build interactive dashboards to optimize operations and support data-driven decision-making. Previously, I contributed as a Data Strategy Research Intern at DataThinkLab, analyzing global data initiatives and improving data quality to drive actionable insights for the hospitality industries.
I hold a Master of Science in Business Analytics from Grand Canyon University, where I led a customer churn prediction project utilizing Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest models, achieving an accuracy of 88.2% and an F1-score of 93.4%. I also hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Control and Automation Engineering from Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto.
Currently, I am advancing my skills through the MIT Applied Data Science Professional Program, focusing on supervised learning, causal inference, feature engineering, and business experimentation. I am passionate about translating complex data into clear, strategic insights that empower organizations and stakeholders.
